Change the parameters in the insurance dataset.
We keep getting 0 Robustness ratio in Meyer and Zorro

MPG Notebook:
boundary_indices, a new series(data structure) if they are not in the indeces to 0, if they are

The array is the new test labels for y labels, then train a decision tree on the y labels using X train data.

Get the branches, get the ones that are most interesting of importance.

after seeing the decision tree, get the "score" , how many points were split off. 



Take the first 10 percent of X train, 

perce = 0.1 * len(X_train)

array_indexes = np.zeros(len(X_train))
for i in range(len(X_train)):
	if i <= perce:
		index = boundary_indices[i]
		array_indexes[index] = 1
	else:
		array[i] = 0 

afterwards, train a decision tree

i don't do anything afterwards, what is the decision tree between these similar values.
